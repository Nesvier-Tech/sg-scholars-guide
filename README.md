Welcome to the README for **SG: Scholar's Guide**, a community-driven College Entrance Exam (CET) Reviewer App. This open-source project is aimed at leveling the playing field for high school students preparing for college entrance exams in the Philippines.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For structuring web content.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For dynamic and interactive features.
- **Svelte (w/ SvelteKit)**: Built on top of JS/TS, a modern web framework for building user interfaces, enhancing the app's performance and maintainability.

## Problem Statement

The current state of college entrance exam preparation in the Philippines exhibits a significant imbalance between privileged and less fortunate students. Privileged students have access to expensive review materials and preparatory courses, giving them a considerable advantage. In contrast, less fortunate students struggle to find tailored, university-specific review materials and personalized guidance. The existing review centers often focus on generalized content, neglecting individual needs and pacing.

## Customer Motivation and Application Characteristics

**Scholar's Guide** is developed to address this imbalance and support students' aspirations for academic excellence. Our initiative is backed by UP Epsilon Chi, an organization committed to diversity and academic excellence, and aligns with UP Diliman's mission. We aim to democratize access to high-quality review materials, ensuring that all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background, have an equal opportunity to excel in college entrance exams.

## The Better Solution

**Scholar's Guide** offers a superior solution compared to existing apps and products. Here's why it stands out:

1. **Continuous Improvement**: Unlike other apps with fixed question banks, Scholar's Guide allows users to contribute and update content continuously, ensuring that the app remains relevant and effective.

2. **Free Accessibility**: The app is completely free, eliminating financial barriers and making quality education accessible to all.

3. **Community Engagement**: The app fosters a supportive environment for peer-to-peer learning and community engagement, enhancing the overall learning experience.

4. **Customization**: Users can tailor their preparation by selecting specific topics and subjects, addressing individual learning needs.

5. **Quality Control**: A robust quality control system ensures content accuracy, reliability, and alignment with CET standards, maintaining consistently high-quality content.

**Scholar's Guide** embraces values of equity, accessibility, and community-driven learning, perfectly aligning with UP Diliman's core values.
